2. **Biblical authority with Holy Spirit guidance** - For faithful
   interpretation *(2 Timothy 3:16-17)*

## ETHICAL
3. **Sacredness of Human Life** - Civil resistance to genocide, oppression, 
   and crimes against humanity *(Genesis 1:27)*

## MISSION
5. **Gospel to the ends of the earth with special focus in Sierra Leone** - 
   Through education that forms disciples committed to peace, justice, and 
   biblical truth *(Acts 1:8)*

## PEDAGOGICAL
6. **Pedagogy of Service: The Five Pillars of Edification** - Our teaching is structured into **Courses**, which are composed of individual **Guides**. Each Guide is a self-contained module of learning designed according to five guiding pillars:

    *   **Focus:** It centers on a single, clear learning objective to ensure clarity and prevent cognitive overload.
    *   **Brevity:** It is concise enough to be completed in one short session (approx. 5-7 minutes or between 400-600 words), respecting the user's time and fostering a sense of accomplishment, in line with the principles of [Micro-learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323919250000150).  From 3 to
    5 comprenhension questions to help with understanding/memory withouth being heavy burden.
    *   **Action:** It equips the user with knowledge that leads to a tangible action or a specific, applicable skill, ensuring our teaching is practical and empowering.
    *   **Joyful Engagement:** It is presented through interactive, game-like activities. We believe learning should not be a chore but a delightful discovery, reflecting the inherent creativity of God's world.
    *   **Accessible Tone:** We write in an informal, relational, and often humorous voice. By rejecting sterile formality, we build bridges of humility and shared humanity. A cheerful heart is good medicine, and we use laughter respectfully as a tool to make complex topics approachable and the learning journey a joyful one.

    This five-pillared methodology ensures our educational work is a true act of service: an orderly, effective, and joyful tool for empowerment and connection. *(1 Corinthians 14:40, Proverbs 17:22)*

## FUNDING
7. **Humanity** We can receive clean money from non-violent people and
   organizations, based on mutual respect and sincere desire of helping
   the needy out of love and mercy.


# From Internal Motivation to Community Action

These foundational principles are communitary expression of our core internal motivations.

| Internal Motivation ("The Heart") | Logical & Theological Connector ("The Reason") | Community Principle ("The Action") |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Love + Respect** | **Because** every person is created in **God's image (Genesis 1:27)**, possessing inherent and inviolable dignity. | **Sacredness of Human Life & Non-Violence** |
| **Diligence + Love** | **Compelled by** Christ's command to make **disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19)**, carrying the integral gospel (word and action). | **Mission to the Ends of the Earth** |
| **Respect + Humility** | **Because** God's Kingdom is characterized by **the justice the Lord requires (Micah 6:8)** and **peace that surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7)**, not by the world's oppression. | **Biblical Peace and Justice** |
| **Diligence + Humility** | **Because** our calling is to **build up, not to overwhelm (1 Corinthians 14:40)**, serving knowledge in a way that is clear, accessible, and joyful. | **Pedagogy: The Five Pillars of Edification** |
| **Love + Respect + Humility + Diligence** | **Because** money can corrupt the mission, but clean resources facilitate it. We are **faithful stewards (1 Corinthians 4:2)** who will give account to God for every partnership. | **Funding: "Humanity" - Only Clean Money** |
