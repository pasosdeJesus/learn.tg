## 1. What are GoodDollar (G$), CELO and Learn.tg-UBI ?

GoodDollar (G$) and CELO are cryptocurrencies that operate on the
**Celo blockchain**.

*   **GoodDollar** is also a global UBI protocol supported by companies like 
    eToro.
*   **Learn.tg-UBI** is an exclusive UBI on learn.tg that gives **CELO tokens** to 
    people (specially in Sierra Leone) and that is sponsored by **Celo Support Streams**.

To ensure fairness and prevent one person from claiming multiple times, both 
UBI systems use **anti-sybil mechanisms**:
*   **GoodDollar:** Requires unique **facial verification** every 6 months.
*   **Learn.tg-UBI:** You need at least **50 points** in your profile score.

**How to get +50 points in profile score?**
1. **GoodDollar Verification (52 points):** Complete the facial verification 
   process, then click "Update Score" on your [profile](/en/profile) page.
2. **Verification with Self (100 points):** Install the [Self](https://self.xyz) app and scan your passport with it. Then, from your profile page on this site, click the **"Verify with Self"** button. This will display a **QR code** (on computers) or directly open the Self app (on smartphones). Scan the QR code with the Self app and authorize sharing your verified **name and country** to receive 100 points.

**Approximate daily value:**
*   **GoodDollar:** ≈150 G$ (≈ $0.01 USD / ~0.25 New Leones). You can save up over several days before converting.
*   **CELO UBI:** Up to 1 CELO daily, depending on your profile score. With 52 points, you receive 0.52 CELO.

**💡 Tip:** Multiple adults in a household can claim, each with their own wallet, all manageable from **a single OKX app**.

### A Strategy for Your UBI: Save and Grow

As you can see, the daily UBI amounts are small. While they add up over time, converting very small amounts to cash can be inefficient due to transaction fees.

A powerful strategy is to **save your UBI** for several days or weeks.

To accelerate your savings, you can **combine your UBI with other earnings** on learn.tg. For example, completing crossword puzzles on the platform rewards you with **1 USDT** for each solved puzzle. By saving your G$, CELO, and adding your USDT earnings, you can accumulate a more significant amount to convert to cash when you need it.

## 2. Step 1: Verify Your Identity with GoodDollar

**Facial verification** ensures your wallet belongs to a **unique real adult (over 18 years old)**.

**How it works:**
1.  You'll use your smartphone's camera to record a short video of your face.
2.  GoodDollar's system extracts your facial features and compares them with a centralized database to avoid duplicates.
3.  **Your facial data is stored securely** and is linked to your wallet address but not to other personal information (like your name).

**Process requirements:**
*   **Time:** About 10 minutes. Done **once** (then every 6 months).
*   **Location:** Good lighting.
*   **Note:** With OKX Wallet, you may need to allow camera access several times (around 5) at the beginning.

## 3. Step 2: Claim Your Daily UBI

Once verified, you can claim daily through your **Web3 wallet** (like OKX, which you set up in Guide 2).

*   **GoodDollar (G$):** You can claim on <https://learn.tg> or the official app at <https://gooddapp.org>.
*   **CELO UBI:** You can only claim it on **this site (learn.tg)**.

**Daily process:** Open the app, click to claim, and the funds are added to your wallet.

**The buttons at the end of this guide will allow you to claim both UBIs.**
