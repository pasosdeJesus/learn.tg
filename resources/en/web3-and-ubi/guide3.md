# Guide 3: Claim Your Daily UBI - GoodDollar and CELO

## 1. What are GoodDollar (G$) and CELO?

GoodDollar (G$) and CELO are cryptocurrencies that operate on the **Celo blockchain**.
*   **GoodDollar** is a global UBI protocol supported by companies like eToro.
*   **CELO UBI** on this site is sponsored by **Celo Support Streams**.

To ensure fairness and prevent one person from claiming multiple times, both systems use **anti-sybil mechanisms**:
*   **GoodDollar:** Requires unique **facial verification** every 6 months.
*   **CELO UBI on learn.tg:** You need at least **50 points** in your profile score.

**How to get +50 points?**
1.  **GoodDollar Verification (52 points):** Complete the facial process, then click "Update Score" on your [profile](/en/profile) page.
2.  **Verification with Self (100 points):** Install the [Self](https://self.xyz) app and scan your passport with it. Then, from your profile page here, click the **"Verify with Self"** button. This will display a **QR code** (on computers) or directly open the Self app (on smartphones). Scan the QR code with the Self app and authorize sharing your verified **name and country** to receive 100 points.

**Approximate daily value:**
*   **GoodDollar:** ~100 G$ (≈ $0.01 USD / ~0.25 New Leones). You can save up over several days before converting.
*   **CELO UBI:** Up to 1 CELO daily, depending on your profile score. With 52 points, you receive 0.52 CELO.

**💡 Tip:** Multiple adults in a household can claim, each with their own wallet, all manageable from **a single OKX app**.

## 2. Step 1: Verify Your Identity with GoodDollar

**Facial verification** ensures your wallet belongs to a **unique real adult (over 18 years old)**.

**How it works:**
1.  You'll use your smartphone's camera to record a short video of your face.
2.  GoodDollar's system extracts your facial features and compares them with a centralized database to avoid duplicates.
3.  **Your facial data is stored securely**, linked **only to your wallet's address**, not to your name or other personal info.

**Process requirements:**
*   **Time:** About 10 minutes. Done **once** (then every 6 months).
*   **Location:** Good lighting.
*   **Note:** With OKX Wallet, you may need to allow camera access several times (around 5) at the beginning.
