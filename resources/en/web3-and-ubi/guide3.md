There will be two buttons here, one to claim GoodDollar and the other to claim
CELO (written in the characters of the Krio pronunciation).

## 1. Introduction

GoodDollar is a digital currency, also called G$. Anyone with a smartphone
and internet can claim some of it every day as Universal Basic Income (UBI), 
which means a small amount of money given for free to help with basic needs.

Signing up by making a video of your face, you can collect aorund 100G$ 
daily, worth about US$0.01 (around 0.25 New Leones). You can save up daily 
G$ over a week or month for converting or buying.  Multiple adults 
in a household can each claim it daily, managing each account in
a different phone or all accounts in on phone with one OKX app.

GoodDollar is supported by companies like eToro and helps to fight
poverty and help people in Sierra Leone and around the world.


## 2. Facial Verification

Facial verification is how GoodDollar ensures that your wallet belongs
to a unique real adult (above 18 years old) and that each person claims 
at most once per day. 

You use your smartphone’s camera to take a short video of your face, 
GoodDollar’s system will retrieve the features of your face and compare
with exisintg ones in a centralized database to make sure it is not 
repeated and then it will store your face features in the database 
not linking it with your personal information (except your wallet's address). 
This keeps the system fair and prevents fraud. 

The process is quick, usually taking less than 10 minutes, and you only
need to do it once during signup --we noticed that with the OKX wallet
it will require permission to open the camera around 5 times but after
it will work.  Make sure you’re in a well-lit place.  The process
will take a couple of minutes and you’ll get a confirmation.

At the end of this guide there is a button to Verify yourself with GoodDollar.


## 3. Claim Daily UBI

After verification, you can claim your daily G$ through your Web3 wallet and 
for example this site https://learn.tg. 
After verification, you can claim your daily G$ through your Web3 wallet, like
OKX on <https://learn.tg> or from the original <https://gooddapp.org/>

Each day, you open the app, click to claim your UBI, and it’s added to your 
wallet.

The button at the end of this guide allows you to claim your daily UBI.
