## 1. Introduction

CELO and GoodDollar (also known as G$) are crypto currencies that operate in 
the CELO blockchain.

GoodDollar is supported by companies like eToro.  The CELO UBI offered in this
site is sponsored by Celo Support Streams.

To avoid that one person uses two different wallets to claim UBIs GoodDollar
and this site use anti-sybil mechanisms:

* Before claiming GoodDollar UBI you need to verify your uniqueness with 
  facial verification, this needs to be done every six months.
* Before claiming CELO UBI you need at least 50 points in your profile score. 
  There are tow ways to have more than 50 points in your profile score:
    1. Doing the GoodDollar uniqueness verification process and pushing 
        the button "Update Score" from the [profile](/en/profile) page 
        gives 52 points.
    2. Installing the [Self](https://self.xyz) app in your phone, scanning 
        your passport with it, from the profile page push verify with self,
        scan with the self app the QR code and accept providing us your
        name and country will give 100 points (52 of uniqueness verification,
        and the rest for verifying your name and country).

GoodDollar  UBI is aroun 100G$ daily, worth about US$0.01 (around 0.25 
New Leones). You can save up daily G$ over a week or month for converting 
or buying.  Multiple adults in a household can each claim it daily, 
managing each account in a different phone or all accounts in on phone 
with one OKX app.

CELO UBI is at most 1 CELO daily, depending on your profile score.  If your
profile score is 52 points you would receive 0.52 CELO.


## 2. GoodDollars's facial verification

Facial verification is how GoodDollar ensures that your wallet belongs
to a unique real adult (above 18 years old) and that each person claims 
at most once per day. 

You use your smartphone’s camera to take a short video of your face, 
GoodDollar’s system will retrieve the features of your face and compare
with exisintg ones in a centralized database to make sure it is not 
repeated and then it will store your face features in the database 
not linking it with your personal information (except your wallet's address). 
This keeps the system fair and prevents fraud. 

The process is quick, usually taking less than 10 minutes, and you only
need to do it once during signup --we noticed that with the OKX wallet
it will require permission to open the camera around 5 times but after
it will work.  Make sure you’re in a well-lit place.  The process
will take a couple of minutes and you’ll get a confirmation.
