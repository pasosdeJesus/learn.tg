### **Introduction**

To use your digital UBI in daily life, you need to convert it into your local
currency. Depending on your country this can be done in different ways:
* There could be services that can connect directly to your bank to convert easily
(like Coinbase in USA).
* There could be markets to buy and sell person to person, or P2P markets of exchanges like OKX and Binance (see the course about OKX at https://learn.tg/en/save-in-dollars-on-OKX).
* There could be services called **on-ramps** and **off-ramps**
    *   **On-Ramp:** A service that converts your local currency (like USD, EUR, or
    SLE) **into** cryptocurrency.
    *   **Off-Ramp:** A service that converts your cryptocurrency **back into** your
    local currency.

The following section provides specific instructions for users in **Sierra
Leone**. Remember, it is best to save your crypto over time and convert a larger amount to make the transaction worthwhile.

#### **Step-by-Step Guide to change crypto for SLE:**

**Step 1: Connect your wallet**
1. Open the OKX web3 wallet (if you are in the exchange remember to push Web3 at the top)
2. Using the search function of the web3 wallet go to **[stable-sl.pdJ.app](https://stable-sl.pdj.app/)**.

**Step 2: Send Your UBI Tokens**
1. Type your name and Orange phone number (Note: currently this service 
   only supports Orange Money).
2. Select the crypto that you are going to change to SLE (e.g CELO)
3. Push the button **Sell**

**Step 3: Set the amount and continue
1. Type the amount of crypto you want to sell and wait some seconds to see
   a quote informing how much SLE you will receive
2. If you agree with the price push the Continue button (you can compare with the
   official rates for example at [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and
   with the market rates in P2P markets of OKX and Binance ).
 
**Step 4: Confirm the transaction**
1. Review the details, check that you typed correctly your phone number
   and that it is registered in your name
  (because the SLE will be sent to that number if it matches your name).
2. Push the Confirm button

**Step 5: Wait for your SLE**
1. Take a screenshot that shows details of the operation and the transaction
   number
2. Wait some minutes for your SLE
3. If you have any issue please use the support button on the site or
   contact the team via Telegram at +57 3165383162

### **Important Considerations**
*   **Fees:** Small transaction fees apply for the network and conversion
    services, you need to have CELO (1 will be enough for more than 10
    transactions) in your wallet to pay for them.
*   **Rates:** Exchange rates vary. Always check the final amount you will
    receive.
*   **Security:** Only use reputable services. Double-check website URLs and
    never share your wallet's Secret Recovery Phrase.
