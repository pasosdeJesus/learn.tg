# Guide 4: Your Bridge to Cash - Using On-Ramps & Off-Ramps

### **Introduction**

To use your digital UBI in daily life, you need to convert it into your local
currency. This can be done through services called **on-ramps** and **off-ramps**, 
which act as bridges between the traditional financial world and the blockchain,
or depending on your country there could be exchanges that can interact with your
bank (like Coinbase in USA) or you could buy and sell to people specialized
using the P2P market of exchanges like OKX and Binance (see the 
course about OKX at https://learn.tg/en/save-in-dollars-on-OKX).

*   **On-Ramp:** A service that converts your local currency (like USD, EUR, or
    SLE) **into** cryptocurrency.
*   **Off-Ramp:** A service that converts your cryptocurrency **back into** your
    local currency.

**Your First Task:** Search online for "buy crypto [Your Country]" or "sell
crypto for [Your Local Currency]" to find a platform that operates in your
region. Popular global exchanges are OKX and Binance.

The following section provides specific instructions for users in **Sierra
Leone** using our local partner.

### **Important Considerations**
*   **Fees:** Small transaction fees apply for the network and conversion
    services, you need to have CELO (1 will be enough for more than 10
    transactions) in your wallet to pay for them.
*   **Rates:** Exchange rates vary. Always check the final amount you will
    receive.
*   **Security:** Only use reputable services. Double-check website URLs and
    never share your wallet's Secret Recovery Phrase.
