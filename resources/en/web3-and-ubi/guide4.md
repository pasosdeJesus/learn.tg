# Guide 4: Your Bridge to Cash - Using On-Ramps & Off-Ramps

### **Introduction**
To use your digital UBI in daily life, you need to convert it into your local
currency. This is done through specialized services called **on-ramps** and
**off-ramps**, which act as bridges between the traditional financial world and
the blockchain.

*   **On-Ramp:** A service that converts your local currency (like USD, EUR, or
    SLE) **into** cryptocurrency.
*   **Off-Ramp:** A service that converts your cryptocurrency **back into** your
    local currency.

**Your First Task:** Search online for "buy crypto [Your Country]" or "sell
crypto for [Your Local Currency]" to find a platform that operates in your
region. Popular global examples include Binance, Kraken, or local exchanges.
Always verify the platform's legitimacy before use.

The following section provides specific instructions for users in **Sierra
Leone** using our local partner.

### **For Users in Sierra Leone: Using stable-sl.pdJ.app**

For a seamless experience in Sierra Leone, we recommend **stable-sl.pdJ.app**.
This service is designed to work directly with Sierra Leonean Leones and mobile
money.

> **Future Note:** stable-sl.pdJ.app will soon partner with learn.tg to verify
> that UBI distributions are exclusively for Sierra Leone nationals, ensuring
> the benefits stay within our community.

#### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

**Step 1: Access and Connect**
1.  Go to **[stable-sl.pdJ.app](https://stable-sl.pdj.app/)**.
2.  Click "Connect Wallet" and select your OKX Web3 Wallet to link it securely.

**Step 2: Send Your UBI Tokens**
1.  On the platform, find your unique **deposit address**.
2.  Open your OKX Wallet, select the UBI tokens (G$ or TLG) you wish to cash
    out, and send them to the provided deposit address.

**Step 3: Convert to Leones**
1.  Once the tokens arrive, use the platform's interface to sell them. You will
    likely convert them first to a stablecoin like cUSD, then to **Sierra
Leonean Leones (SLL)**.
2.  Review the final exchange rate and amount in Leones before confirming.

**Step 4: Withdraw to Your Account**

    Money, Afrimoney).
2.  Initiate the withdrawal. Funds typically arrive within minutes to a few
    hours.

### **Important Considerations**
*   **Fees:** Small transaction fees apply for the network and conversion
    services.
*   **Rates:** Exchange rates vary. Always check the final amount you will
    receive.

    never share your wallet's Secret Recovery Phrase.
