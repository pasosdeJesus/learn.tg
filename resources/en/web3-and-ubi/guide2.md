### **Introduction**

Your **Web3 wallet** is your personal gateway to the blockchain. It's like a 
digital passport and bank account in one, allowing you to securely receive, 
store, and manage your digital UBI and your identification.

For this course, we recommend the **OKX Web3 Wallet** or MetaMask. 
They are user-friendly, support the Celo network (which powers our UBI projects),
and they have helpful built-in tools for beginners.

Your wallet’s security depends entirely on one thing: your 
**Secret Recovery Phrase**. As the master key to your digital assets, whoever 
possesses it has full control.

### **Step-by-Step: Installing the OKX Web3 Wallet**

#### **Step 1: Install the Wallet**
*  On your smartphone install the OKX wallet (its icon is black and green) 
   or the OKX application (its icon is white and black). If you install the OKX
   application, choose "Web3" at the top to switch from the Exchange to the
   web3 wallet.

#### **Step 2: Create a New Wallet**
*   Open the OKX Wallet and tap **"Create Wallet"**.
*   You will be prompted to set a strong password or biometric method
    for daily access to this device.

#### **Step 3: Secure Your Secret Recovery Phrase (THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP)**
*   The wallet will generate a unique **12-word Secret Recovery Phrase**.
*   **Write these 12 words down on paper, in the exact order shown.**
*   **⚠️ Critical Security Rules:**
    *   **NEVER** save it as a screenshot, digital note, or email.
    *   **NEVER** share it with anyone for any reason.
    *   Store the paper in a safe, physical place.
*   Confirm you have written it down correctly by selecting the words in order.

The procedure is presented in this video:

#### **Step 4: Access Your Wallet**
* Your wallet is now ready! You will see your wallet's **public address** 
  (a long string starting with `0x...`). This is like your account number—you can share it to receive funds.
