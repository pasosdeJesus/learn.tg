### Introduction

**Universal Basic Income (UBI)** is a  regular, unconditional payment given 
to all members of a community to help cover basic needs.  This course will walk you through how to receive two kinds of digital UBI: GoodDollar and learn.tg-UBI.

**Bonus Opportunity:** Each lesson on learn.tg features a scholarship vault!
When you answer all comprehension questions correctly in a guide, you become
eligible to receive USDT from that lesson's vault - as long as donors have
contributed to support learners in the course. You can even donate to vaults
yourself to support others!

To receive and use this digital UBI, you will need to understand a few 
key tools and concepts, which we will explain in this guide.

### The Four Key Concepts You Need to Know


#### 1. Blockchain (The Foundation)
A **blockchain** (or **network**) is a secure, public, and decentralized digital ledger that
records transactions across the Internet. Think of it as a shared
database that no single entity controls, making the records transparent and very
difficult to alter.

*   **Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum and **Celo**.

> **Why it matters for you:** The Celo blockchain is the secure foundation that
> powers the UBI you will receive, ensuring your payments are reliable and
> tamper-proof.

#### 2. Cryptocurrency (The Digital Asset)
A **cryptocurrency** (or just **crypto**) is a digital asset designed to 
work as a medium of exchange on its specific blockchain. It can be the 
native coin of a network or a token built on top of it.

*   **Native Coin:** The main currency of a blockchain (for example CELO on the Celo
    network).
*   **Token:** A digital asset built on an existing blockchain (for example GoodDollar
    **G$** and USDT on Celo).

> **Why it matters for you:** The UBI you claim will be in the form of
> cryptocurrency tokens (G$ and CELO), while the bonus scholarships are in USDT
> all of which live on the Celo blockchain.


#### 3. Web3 Wallet & Digital Identity (Your Passport)
A **Web3 wallet** is your digital passport for interacting with blockchains. It
does two key things:
1.  **Manages Your Assets:** It securely stores the cryptographic keys that
    control your digital money (like cryptocurrencies).
2.  **Manages Your Identity:** It proves who you are to web3 applications 
    (like this platform).

To prevent fraud and ensure UBI reaches unique individuals, your identity must
be verified. This is done through a **facial verification process** with a
project like **GoodDollar**.

For each blockchain, your Web3 wallet manages a unique set of keys:
* **Your Public Address**: This is like your bank account number. Share it 
  freely to receive funds.
* **Your Private Key (Seed Phrase)**: This is a 12-24 word master password. 
  Anyone who knows it owns your wallet and all its funds. Never share it.

> **Why it matters for you:** Your wallet stores your funds, while the facial
> verification with GoodDollar secures your unique identity for claiming UBI.
> Together, they ensure a fair and secure system for everyone.


#### 4. On-Ramp & Off-Ramp (The Bridge to Your Money)
These are services that act as a bridge between traditional money (fiat) and
cryptocurrency.

*   **On-Ramp:** Converts your local currency (for example Leones) into cryptocurrency.
*   **Off-Ramp:** Converts your cryptocurrency back into Leones for use in
    Sierra Leone.

For this course, we will use <https://stable-sl.pdJ.app>, a service specifically
designed for Sierra Leone. This platform makes it easy to convert between 
Leones and digital assets.

> **Why it matters for you:** This is how you will convert your digital UBI into
> cash for your daily needs in Sierra Leone.
