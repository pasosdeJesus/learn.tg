> **45** Immediately He made his disciples get into the boat, and go ahead
   to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He himself sent the multitude away.
   **46** After He had taken leave of them, He went up the mountain to pray.

>  **47** When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and
   He was alone on the land.
   **48** Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them,
   about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and
   He would have passed by them, **49 **but they, when they saw Him walking on
   the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
   **50** for they all saw Him, and were troubled. But He immediately spoke with
   them, and said to them, “Cheer up! It is I! Don’t be afraid.”
   **51** He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were
   very amazed among themselves, and marveled;
   **52** for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were
   hardened.
